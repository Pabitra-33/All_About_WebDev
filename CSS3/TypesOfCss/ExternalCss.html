        <h1>External Css Styling In Html</h1>
        <p>
            <b>External CSS</b> is a method for defining CSS styles directly within an HTML document. It's particularly useful for applying unique styles to multiple web pages, and it's embedded within the link tag and located in the head section of the HTML file.

            <b>How to Use Internal CSS : </b>
        >6To use internal CSS, we<strong> need to include CSS rules within a style tag</strong> inside the HTML document's head tag. This allows you to define styles by selecting html elements or classes and applying styling rules within the tag. The styles defined by internal CSS apply only to the specific web page where they are included.
