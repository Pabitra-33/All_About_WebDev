        Welcome CSS Box Model!
        The CSS box model refers to how HTML elements are modeled in browser engines and how the dimensions of those HTML elements are derived from CSS properties. It is a fundamental concept for the composition of HTML webpages.
        The CSS box model is essentially a box that wraps around every HTML element. It consists of: content, padding, borders and margins.
